# OBJ_Pygame
Example loading obj 3d models using OpenGL / Pygame as launched in a Jupyter notebook (Python 3.x version)
This example loads a 3D tree model in 4 parts.

To use:  The file objloader.py should be in your default Jupyter notebook folder, alongside the objtester.ipynb file.

All 4 .obj files (this example has 4) MUST have the full path to the .mtl files in the header (even if .obj and .mtl files reside in the same folder).  

The first cell in objtester should be edited to reflect the location of where you have stored the obj/mtl files.
